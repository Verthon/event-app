Simple React app for creating and managing events. In project I have used:

- React.js (create-react-app)
- JavaScript ES6
- Firestore
- React Router
- CSS (Mobile first)
- Unit tests (Jest)

## Functionality

1. Creating new event, information required:
  * event name
  * event description

  * date(date-picker)
  * photo (no upload, only links)
  * category 
2. Displaying all events
3. Search function
4. Authorization
5. Editing, deleting created event
