Simple React app for creating and managing events. In project I have used:

- React.js (create-react-app)
- JavaScript ES6
- Firestore
- React Router
- Redux
- CSS (Mobile first)
- Unit tests (Jest)
- Wonderful illustrations created by [Katerina Limpitsouni](https://twitter.com/ninalimpi) from [undraw.co/](https://undraw.co/) 


## Functionality

1. Creating new event, information required:
  * event name

  * date(date-picker)
  * photo (no upload, only links https://source.unsplash.com/)
